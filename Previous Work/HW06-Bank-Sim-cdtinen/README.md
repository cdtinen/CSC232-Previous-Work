# HW06-Bank-Sim-cdtinen

This repository is for homework 6, the banking simulation project. It is an event-driven simulation of a bank, with a queue of arrival events representing customers. A input text file is used for arrival and transaction times. The program prints processing times for arrival and departure events, as well as final statistics of total number of people processed, and average amount of time spent waiting.
