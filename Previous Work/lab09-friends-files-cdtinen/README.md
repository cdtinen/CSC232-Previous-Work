# Lab09 - Friend Functions, overloading stream insertion operator and reading text files

## Goal

In this lab, the student will learn to read data from input files.

## Tasks

1. Create a develop branch within in which to do your work.
1. Create a `HealthTracker` class that has (private) attributes to store `weight` and `fatPercent` and (public) accessor and mutator methods for those attributes. Also have an initializing constructor that allows one to initialize the attributes with particular values (there should be no default constructor).
1. Modify the `Demo.cpp` file to read the health data from `input.dat` in a manner similar to what you see in `Main.cpp` but instead, store the data into `HealthTracker` instances.
1. Add each `HealthTracker` instance to a `std::vector<HealthTracker>`.
1. Print out the average weight and fat percent of all the data stored in the vector.

## Due Date

This lab is due at the end of the lab period.
